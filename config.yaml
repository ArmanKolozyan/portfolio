    description: |
      I am a Master's student in Computer Science from Belgium, studying at the <a href="https://www.vub.be/en/studying-vub/all-study-programmes-vub/bachelors-and-masters-programmes-vub/applied-sciences-and-engineering-computer-science/program/master/master-software-languages-and-software-engineering" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a>. My research experience lies in security, specifically in vulnerability analysis of network protocols and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). Currently, I am working on my master's thesis in collaboration with <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/locations/antwerp-belgium" target="_blank">Nokia Bell Labs</a>, where I am investigating bugs in ZKP programs. Previously, I completed a research internship at <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/" target="_blank">KU Leuven's COSIC group</a>, where I conducted a security analysis of the Matter standard for smart home devices. My main research goal is to make technologies more secure in order to protect our privacy and data.

        url: "https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1268"

          This paper is based on the work I conducted, together with my supervisors, during my internship at COSIC. 
          It presents the first formal and practical security analysis of the Matter protocol, an IoT standard adopted by Apple, Google, Amazon, and others. 
          Our work identifies design and implementation vulnerabilities in its key-establishment protocols (PASE and CASE), and proposes improvements to strengthen the protocol. 
          We responsibly disclosed these issues, some of which led to patches in the official codebase.

          EOS Wetenschap is a renowned Belgian monthly magazine that reports on recent developments in science for a general audience. 
          While not a peer-reviewed academic journal, it has a professional editorial board and often features articles from professors and researchers. 
          This article, written in Dutch, explores whether anyone can become a memory champion by applying techniques such as the memory palace. 
          Quoting from the journal: "Arman Kolozyan is 19 years old. He graduated in Science-Mathematics from GO! Atheneum Emanuel Hiel and has always 
          dreamed of having a fantastic memory. Can anyone become a memory champion? He researched this question and wrote an article on his findings."
